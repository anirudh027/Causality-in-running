## Introduction

This project explores the various factors that influence running performance, such as training intensity, nutrition, rest, and environmental conditions. By leveraging data analysis and causal inference techniques, we aim to provide insights that can help runners optimize their performance.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Causality-in-Running.git
```

## Usage

There are a total of 2 main steps in this project:

1. Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. The raw data is expected to be in the form of a CSV file with columns representing different variables. Check the `preprocessing.ipynb` for more details.
2. Running the Causal Analysis: This step involves running the causal analysis to identify the causal relationships between different variables. Check the `cfdml.ipynb` for causal analysis using Causal Forests using Double Machine Learning or `tmle.r` for causal analysis using Targeted Maximum Likelyhood estimation.

Make sure to customize the configuration file `config.yaml` to suit your specific needs.
